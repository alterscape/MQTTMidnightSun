# MQTT Midnight Sun

This project is an Arduino-based ESP2866 hack. It is intended to connect a
JRTronic 100W PWM LED controller to an ESP2866, and expose brightness as an
MQTT endpoint. If successful, I'll be modifying it to support more than one
JRTronic driver, with the goal of fading between 5600k "daylight" and 3200k
"tungsten" color balance.

Big picture, I'm trying to make a big bright light source so my brain doesn't
get so grumpy that I'm biking home from work in the dark every night this
winter.

## Build Requirements
* [Arduino ESP2866 core](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
* [Arduino PubSub Client](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient/) (Can be
installed via Library Manager).
